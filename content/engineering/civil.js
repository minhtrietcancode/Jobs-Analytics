                        <p>Civil Engineering focuses on designing, constructing, and maintaining infrastructure such as buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and water supply systems. It combines structural mechanics, environmental science, and geotechnical engineering to ensure safe and sustainable development.</p>
                        <p>In Australia, civil engineers are in high demand due to major transportation projects, urban development, and renewable energy infrastructure. Key employers include Arup, AECOM, WSP, SMEC, John Holland, CPB Contractors, and the Australian Government.</p>
