                        <p>Physical Therapy (Physiotherapy) & Rehabilitation is a healthcare field focused on restoring movement and function for people affected by injuries, illnesses, or disabilities. In Australia, physiotherapists and rehabilitation specialists work in hospitals, private clinics, aged care, sports medicine, and research. This field plays a crucial role in sports recovery, post-surgical rehabilitation, disability support, and chronic pain management. With an ageing population and increased focus on health and wellness, demand for physiotherapists in Australia is rising.</p>
