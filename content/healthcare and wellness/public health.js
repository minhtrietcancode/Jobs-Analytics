                        <p>Public Health is a multidisciplinary field focused on protecting and improving community health through disease prevention, health education, and policy development. Unlike medicine, which treats individuals, public health focuses on large populations and aims to prevent illnesses before they occur. In Australia, public health professionals work in government agencies, research institutions, non-profit organisations, and private companies to address issues such as infectious disease control, mental health, Indigenous health, and environmental health.</p>
